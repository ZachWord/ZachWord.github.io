    "text": "On September 9, 2024, Dak Prescott became the highest-paid player in the National Football League, signing a four-year, $240 million contract extension with the Dallas Cowboys. His contract gave him an $80 million signing bonus and carries an annual value of $60 million per season. In other words, he is making $164,383.56 per day, $6,849.32 per hour, $114.16 per minute, or $1.90 per second. As crazy as those numbers are, they will only continue to grow for his peers at a steady pace over the coming years, as the quarterback position market value only continues to grow. The market for NFL running backs, contrary to other positions like wide receiver and quarterback, has been rather stagnant.\nThere are several reasons why the running back market is declining. First, the position is very physically demanding, which shortens the chances of being able to play for many years. This leads teams to be hesitant to give running backs large contracts, especially in an era where it seems as though they can be quickly replaced with cheaper and younger options. Many teams have also switched to a running back-by-committee approach instead of leaning on one guy. However, some running backs have been dominant for several years now, even in the modern era of the NFL.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp_data &lt;- load_pbp(seasons = 2010:2023) \n\n\n\n\nCode\nroster_data &lt;- nflreadr::load_rosters(seasons = 2010:2023)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_pbp_data &lt;- pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(rusher_player_id))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_stats &lt;- pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(rusher_id == \"RB\") |&gt;\n  group_by(season, rusher_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_rush_attempts = sum(rush_attempt, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_stats &lt;- rb_pbp_data |&gt;\n  group_by(season, rusher_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_rush_attempts = sum(rush_attempt, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_stats_season &lt;- rb_pbp_data |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_rushing_yards = mean(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhighlighted_players &lt;- c(\"Derrick Henry\", \"Christian McCaffrey\", \"Saquon Barkley\") \n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_stats_highlighted &lt;- rb_pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(rusher_player_name %in% highlighted_players) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, rusher_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nleague_avg_stats &lt;- rb_pbp_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(rushing_yards)) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_team_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avg_team_rushing_yards = mean(total_team_rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = rb_stats_highlighted, aes(x = season, y = total_rushing_yards, group = rusher_player_name, color = rusher_player_name), size = 1) +\n  geom_line(data = league_avg_stats, aes(x = season, y = avg_team_rushing_yards, color = \"League Average\"), size = 1, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"The top running backs nearly match the NFL average on their own\",\n       subtitle = \"2020 was a bad year, for almost everyone\",\n       x = \"Season\",\n       y = \"Average Rushing Yards\",\n       caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source: nflverse\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"green\", \"purple\", \"blue\")) +  \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nAccording to the chart, running backs like Derrick Henry, Saquon Barkley, and Christian McCaffrey have been close to matching the rest of the league’s rushing yards per season by themselves. However, Barkley and McCaffrey missed 23 of 33 games from 2020-2021. Nonetheless, as seen in the chart, Christian McCaffrey has been unreal in recent years, surpassing the average total rushing yards for every team in the NFL by himself. Consequentially, he is the highest-paid running back in the league, making over $15 million per year. So, how do the ten highest-paid running backs in the league compare in rushing yards in 2023?\n\n\nCode\nhighest_paid_rbs &lt;- c(\"C.McCaffrey\", \"A.Kamara\", \"D.Henry\", \"N.Chubb\", \"A.Jones\", \"S.Barkley\", \"T.Pollard\", \"J.Jacobs\", \"J.Conner\", \"M.Sanders\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp_2023 &lt;- load_pbp(2023)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_yards &lt;- pbp_2023 |&gt;\n  filter(play_type == \"run\" & rusher_player_name %in% highest_paid_rbs) |&gt;\n  group_by(rusher_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_rushing_yards))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(rb_yards, aes(x = reorder(rusher_player_name, -total_rushing_yards), y = total_rushing_yards, fill = rusher_player_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Christain McCaffrey is in a league of his own\",\n    subtitle = \"The rest of the top 10 lag behind\",\n    x = \"Top 10 Highest Paid Running Backs\",\n    y = \"Rushing Yards in 2023\",\n    caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source: nflverse\",\n    fill = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, Christian McCaffrey is worth the money, but it is also worth acknowledging that Nick Chubb missed most of the 2023 season after suffering a season-ending injury in week two.\nSo, does having one of the highest-paid running backs in the league contribute to more team scoring? By simple reasoning, one could assume that if a team is paying a running back a lot of money, he is a good player who can contribute a lot of scoring for the offense. I mean, after all, winning games just means scoring more than the other team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp_2023 &lt;- pbp_2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    points = case_when(\n      play_type == \"pass\" & !is.na(td_team) ~ 6,  \n      play_type == \"run\" & !is.na(td_team) ~ 6,    \n      play_type == \"field_goal\" ~ 3,              \n      TRUE ~ 0                                    \n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats_2023 &lt;- pbp_2023 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(posteam), points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalPoints = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE),\n    GamesPlayed = n_distinct(game_id),\n    AvgPoints = TotalPoints / GamesPlayed\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgPoints))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntop10_offenses &lt;- team_stats_2023 |&gt;\n  slice_max(AvgPoints, n = 10)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntop10_offenses |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    posteam = \"Team\",\n    TotalPoints = \"Total Points Scored\",\n    AvgPoints = \"Points Per Game\",\n    GamesPlayed = \"Games Played\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Top 10 Scoring Offenses in 2023\",\n    subtitle = \"Based on average points per game\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = everything(),\n      rows = posteam %in% c(\"DAL\", \"SF\", \"CLE\")\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Zach Wordekemper  |  **Source:** nflreadr\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Scoring Offenses in 2023\n\n\nBased on average points per game\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Points Scored\nGames Played\nPoints Per Game\n\n\n\n\nSF\n519\n20\n25.95000\n\n\nMIA\n456\n18\n25.33333\n\n\nDAL\n453\n18\n25.16667\n\n\nBAL\n474\n19\n24.94737\n\n\nDET\n498\n20\n24.90000\n\n\nBUF\n450\n19\n23.68421\n\n\nLA\n420\n18\n23.33333\n\n\nCLE\n399\n18\n22.16667\n\n\nPHI\n393\n18\n21.83333\n\n\nNO\n369\n17\n21.70588\n\n\n\nBy: Zach Wordekemper | Source: nflreadr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree out of the top 10 highest paid running back’s offenses are in the top 10 scoring offenses from 2023.

In that case, pay the man."
