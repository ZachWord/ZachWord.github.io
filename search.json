    "section": "",
    "text": "The NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award is given each year to the best performing player of the regular season. In 2018, James Harden won the award averaging 30.8 points per game, 5.4 rebounds per game, and 8.8 assists per game. In 2019, he was second in the MVP voting after having one of the most impressive offensive statistical seasons of all time. One of the most important factors in MVP voting is points per game (PPG) and team success. Let’s see how James Harden’s team, the Houston Rockets, were scoring compared to the rest of the league.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(hoopR)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnba_pbp &lt;- hoopR::load_nba_pbp(2019)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nseason_data &lt;- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(seasons = 2019)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplayer_stats &lt;- season_data |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    games_played = n(),\n    total_points = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_assists = sum(assists, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_rebounds = sum(rebounds, na.rm = TRUE),\n    points_per_game = mean(points, na.rm = TRUE),\n    assists_per_game = mean(assists, na.rm = TRUE),\n    rebounds_per_game = mean(rebounds, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTeamPPG &lt;- season_data |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    totalgames= n(),\ntotalpoints = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE))|&gt;\n  mutate(PPG = totalpoints/totalgames)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTeamPPG &lt;- season_data |&gt;\n  filter(!team_name %in% c(\"Team LeBron\", \"Team Giannis\", \"World\", \"USA\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(team_name, game_id) |&gt;\n  summarize(points_per_game = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(team_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    totalgames = n(),\n    totalpoints = sum(points_per_game, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(PPG = totalpoints / totalgames)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(TeamPPG, aes(x = PPG, y = reorder(team_name, PPG))) +\n  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = ifelse(team_name == \"Rockets\", \"red\", \"grey\")), size = 3) +\n  scale_color_identity() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Houston Rockets were 11th in Points Per Game\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2019 Champions, Toronto, were 12th\",\n    x = \"Points Per Game (PPG)\",\n    y = \"Team\",\n     caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source:hoopR, GitHub's package for NBA data\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmvp_candidates &lt;- c(\"Giannis Antetokounmpo\", \"James Harden\", \"Paul George\", \n                    \"Nikola Jokic\", \"Stephen Curry\", \"Damian Lillard\", \n                    \"Joel Embiid\", \"Kevin Durant\", \"Kawhi Leonard\", \"Russell Westbrook\")\n\nplayer_stats_2019 &lt;- season_data |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% mvp_candidates) |&gt;\n  filter(season == \"2019\") |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    games_played = n(),\n    total_points = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE),\n    PPG = total_points / games_played\n  )\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors were the NBA Champions of the 2018-19 season. They were led by Kawhi Leonard, who finished 9th in MVP voting. So, maybe team success is not as big of a factor in MVP voting. Nonetheless, individual player scoring is still incredibly important when it comes to the MVP. Let’s see how James Harden compared to the other MVP nominees.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(player_stats_2019, aes(x = reorder(athlete_display_name, PPG), y = PPG, fill = athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"James Harden\" = \"#CE1141\", \n    \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\" = \"#00471B\", \n    \"default\" = \"grey\"\n  )) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"James Harden was well above the other MVP candidates in PPG\",\n    subtitle = \"MVP Winner Giannis Anetetokounmpo was fifth among candidates\",\n    x = \"2018-19 Most Valuable Player Nominees\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game (PPG)\",\n     caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source:hoopR, GitHub's package for NBA data\"\n  ) +\n  expand_limits(y = c(0, 40)) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplayer_stats_mvp &lt;- season_data |&gt;\n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% mvp_candidates) |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name, game_date) |&gt;\n  summarize(daily_points = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(cumulative_PPG = cumsum(daily_points) / cumsum(!is.na(daily_points)))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplayer_stats_mvp_filtered &lt;- player_stats_mvp %&gt;%\n  filter(format(game_date, \"%m\") %in% c(\"11\", \"12\", \"01\", \"02\", \"03\", \"04\"))\n\n\nClearly, James Harden was scoring a lot more than anyone else. It got to the point where he was being guarded from behind, as teams had no answer for how to stop the prolific scorer. On December 13, 2018, he recorded a 50-point triple-double. Including that game, he averaged 40.8 points per game for the rest of December. Let’s see how his scoring looked over the course of the 2018-19 season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(player_stats_mvp_filtered, aes(x = game_date, y = cumulative_PPG, color = athlete_display_name)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"Player\",\n    values = c(\n      \"James Harden\" = \"#CE1141\", \n      \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\" = \"#00471B\", \n      \"default\" = \"grey\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"James Harden was a tier above the rest\",\n    subtitle = \"Harden had 3 50-point and 8 40-point games in January\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game (PPG)\",\n     caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source:hoopR, GitHub's package for NBA data\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    breaks = \"1 month\", \n    labels = date_format(\"%b %Y\"),\n    limits = c(min(player_stats_mvp_filtered$game_date), max(player_stats_mvp_filtered$game_date))\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(15, 40)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, James Harden’s scoring ability was in a league of its own during the 2018-19 season. There are other factors that go into MVP voting, and perhaps he was experiencing some voter fatigue after winning MVP the previous season. Nonetheless, these visualizations prove that James Harden was snubbed from winning MVP and should have won back-to-back MVP awards."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On September 9, 2024, Dak Prescott became the highest-paid player in the National Football League, signing a four-year, $240 million contract extension with the Dallas Cowboys. His contract gave him an $80 million signing bonus and carries an annual value of $60 million per season. In other words, he is making $164,383.56 per day, $6,849.32 per hour, $114.16 per minute, or $1.90 per second.\nAs crazy as those numbers are, they will only continue to grow for his peers at a steady pace over the coming years, as the quarterback position market value only continues to grow. The market for NFL running backs, contrary to other positions like wide receiver, quarterback, and edge rusher, has been rather stagnant.\nThere are several reasons why the running back market isn’t growing. First, the position is very physically demanding, which shortens the chances of being able to play for many years. This leads teams to be hesitant to give running backs large contracts, especially in an era where it seems as though they can be quickly replaced with cheaper and younger options. Many teams have also switched to a running back-by-committee approach instead of leaning on one guy.\nIt can be hard to convince a general manager to offer running backs large, long-term contracts when the position is full of inconsistencies. Even some of the best running backs in the NFL over the last five years have struggled to stay consistent.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(nflverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp_data &lt;- load_pbp(seasons = 2010:2023) \n\n\n\n\nCode\nroster_data &lt;- nflreadr::load_rosters(seasons = 2010:2023)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplayers &lt;- c(\"D.Henry\", \"C.McCaffrey\", \"S.Barkley\", \"J.Taylor\", \"A.Kamara\")\nseasons &lt;- 2019:2023\n\n\n\n\nCode\noffense_data &lt;- load_player_stats(stat_type = \"offense\", seasons = seasons)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrushing_data &lt;- offense_data |&gt;\n  filter(player_name %in% players, !is.na(rushing_yards)) |&gt;\n  select(season, player_name, rushing_yards) |&gt;\n  group_by(season, player_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(rushing_data, aes(x = season, y = total_rushing_yards, color = player_name, group = player_name)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The statistical career of an NFL running back is not an even road\",\n    subtitle = \"Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley missed 23 of 33 games from 2020-2021\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    color = \"Players\",\n    caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source:nflverse\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seasons) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(size = 14),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, Christian McCaffrey had a great season in 2023. Consequentially, he is the highest-paid running back in the league, making over $15 million per year. However, he is once again facing injury problems in 2024 after he missed the first eight weeks of the season. With a history of injuries, was what he did in 2023 impressive enough to still warrant being the highest paid running back in the league? Well, let’s look at how the ten highest paid running backs in 2023 compared.\n\n\nCode\nhighest_paid_rbs &lt;- c(\"C.McCaffrey\", \"A.Kamara\", \"D.Henry\", \"N.Chubb\", \"A.Jones\", \"S.Barkley\", \"T.Pollard\", \"J.Jacobs\", \"J.Conner\", \"M.Sanders\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp_2023 &lt;- load_pbp(2023)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrb_yards &lt;- pbp_2023 |&gt;\n  filter(play_type == \"run\" & rusher_player_name %in% highest_paid_rbs) |&gt;\n  group_by(rusher_player_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_rushing_yards = sum(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_rushing_yards))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(rb_yards, aes(x = reorder(rusher_player_name, -total_rushing_yards), y = total_rushing_yards, fill = rusher_player_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Christian McCaffrey is in a league of his own\",\n    subtitle = \"The rest of the top ten lag behind\",\n    x = \"Top 10 Highest Paid Running Backs in 2023\",\n    y = \"Rushing Yards in 2023\",\n    caption = \"By: Zach Wordekemper | Source: nflverse\",\n    fill = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, you could argue that Christian McCaffrey is worth the money. However, it is also worth acknowledging that Nick Chubb missed most of the 2023 season after suffering a season-ending injury in week two. Showing another example of one of the best running backs in the league going down to an unpredictable injury, which heavily hurts the teams investing in them.\nAn important question to be asked, is does having one of the highest-paid running backs in the league contribute to more team scoring? By simple reasoning, one could assume that if a team is paying a running back a lot of money, he is a good player who can contribute a lot of scoring for the offense. I mean, after all, winning games just means scoring more than the other team.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp_2023 &lt;- pbp_2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    points = case_when(\n      play_type == \"pass\" & !is.na(td_team) ~ 6,  \n      play_type == \"run\" & !is.na(td_team) ~ 6,    \n      play_type == \"field_goal\" ~ 3,              \n      TRUE ~ 0                                    \n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats_2023 &lt;- pbp_2023 |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(posteam), points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  group_by(posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalPoints = sum(points, na.rm = TRUE),\n    GamesPlayed = n_distinct(game_id),\n    AvgPoints = TotalPoints / GamesPlayed\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgPoints))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntop10_offenses &lt;- team_stats_2023 |&gt;\n  slice_max(AvgPoints, n = 10)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntop10_offenses |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    posteam = \"Team\",\n    TotalPoints = \"Total Points Scored\",\n    AvgPoints = \"Points Per Game\",\n    GamesPlayed = \"Games Played\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Three of the top ten offenses had one of the most expensive running backs\",\n    subtitle = \"Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco scored a lot\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = everything(),\n      rows = posteam %in% c(\"DAL\", \"SF\", \"CLE\")\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Zach Wordekemper  |  **Source:** nflverse\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree of the top ten offenses had one of the most expensive running backs\n\n\nChristian McCaffrey and San Francisco scored a lot\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Points Scored\nGames Played\nPoints Per Game\n\n\n\n\nSF\n519\n20\n25.95000\n\n\nMIA\n456\n18\n25.33333\n\n\nDAL\n453\n18\n25.16667\n\n\nBAL\n474\n19\n24.94737\n\n\nDET\n498\n20\n24.90000\n\n\nBUF\n450\n19\n23.68421\n\n\nLA\n420\n18\n23.33333\n\n\nCLE\n399\n18\n22.16667\n\n\nPHI\n393\n18\n21.83333\n\n\nNO\n369\n17\n21.70588\n\n\n\nBy: Zach Wordekemper | Source: nflverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the chart, one could make the assumption that having a highly payed running back is not always the most effective equation for a good offense. Obviously, if you are lucky enough to have a really good quarterback, it is important to get them paid on a long-term contract. If you have an elite wide receiver, it is probably safer to invest in them, as the position is more durable than running backs. It is hard to argue for the case of paying running backs expensive, long-term contracts, as the position can be so inconsistent, and doesn’t really have a direct correlation with scoring a lot of points. Unless of course, you have an anomaly like Christian McCaffrey. Who, in his case, might just be worth the money."
